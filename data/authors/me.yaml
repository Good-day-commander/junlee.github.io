bio: |
  I develop AI-driven non-invasive biomarker prediction systems using
  photoplethysmography (PPG) signals, bridging computational fluid dynamics
  and deep learning for clinical diagnostics. My recent work on physics-integrated
  blood viscosity assessment was published in Computer Methods and Programs
  in Biomedicine (2025).
