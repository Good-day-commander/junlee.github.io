## About Me

I am a graduate researcher at the Multi-scale Fluid Dynamics Lab (MFDL BIOS),
working at the intersection of biomedical engineering and artificial intelligence.
My research focuses on developing AI-powered non-invasive diagnostic systems using
photoplethysmography (PPG) signals, with applications in fluid loading prediction,
dehydration assessment, and blood viscosity analysis.

I collaborate with clinical partners at Severance Hospital and other medical institutions,
conducting IRB-approved studies for emergency medicine and cardiovascular applications.
