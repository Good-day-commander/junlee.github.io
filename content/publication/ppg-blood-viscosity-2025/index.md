abstract: >
  A physics-integrated deep learning approach using a hybrid 1D CNN-LSTM
  neural network to estimate patient-specific non-Newtonian blood viscosity
  from photoplethysmography (PPG) signals. The optimized model achieves
  81.1% overall accuracy with 84.0% in the physiological shear range.
  IRB-approved study conducted at Severance Hospital, Yonsei University.
