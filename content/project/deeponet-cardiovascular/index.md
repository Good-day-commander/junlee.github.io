## Overview
Applied Deep Operator Networks (DeepONet) to cardiovascular hemodynamics,
enabling rapid patient-specific blood flow predictions with physics-informed
neural network architectures.

## Key Features
- Operator learning for parametric cardiovascular flows
- Physics-informed loss functions incorporating Navier-Stokes equations
- Generalization across varying patient geometries
