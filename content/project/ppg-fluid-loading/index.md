## Overview
Developed a non-invasive AI system that predicts fluid loading responsiveness
using photoplethysmography (PPG) signals.

## Key Results
- Patient-level averaging: AUC 0.75
- 5-model ensemble: AUC ~0.85
- 7-model ensemble: AUC ~0.86

## Clinical Collaboration
Conducted in partnership with Severance Hospital under IRB approval.
