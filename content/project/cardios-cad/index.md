## Overview
Developed an optimized FFR (Fractional Flow Reserve) prediction algorithm
that incorporates hemodynamic flow features and biometric data, addressing
limitations of conventional AI-based coronary diagnosis that relied solely
on vessel imaging.

## Key Contributions
- Incorporated hemodynamic features beyond vessel imaging
- Synthetic model generation for training data augmentation
- Improved prediction accuracy in the diagnostic gray zone
- Biometric data integration for patient-specific assessment
