## Overview
Developed a Physics-Informed Neural Operator (PINO) framework for
predicting coronary artery blood flow patterns, providing a fast
surrogate for computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations.

## Key Contributions
- Orders of magnitude faster than traditional CFD
- Physics-constrained training for physically consistent results
- Validated against high-fidelity simulation benchmarks
